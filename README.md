This is the backend for [Buildspace's NFT Project](https://buildspace.so/build-nfts)

Check out the final product [here](https://nft-starter-project.mmiller9913.repl.co/). Go ahead and mint and NFT using the Rinkeby test network (just make sure you have some test ETH in your wallet)

To deploy the smart contract, run "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby"

To mint and NFT locally, run "npx hardhat run scripts/run.js"
